Though I am working but still I don't have the independence <br>that is required for a person to freely move. I have <br>to ask for permission for mostly everything and can't<br> do things on my own. People take advantage of my simplicity<br> at workplace as I can not say no to work and for that matter <br>I am overloaded with work or given a task which I am not <br>supposed to do but I still do it. Forced to believe that a woman<br> is always wrong may that be driving a car on the road<br> or looking after your kids or even cooking in your own kitchen...<br>a man can never be wrong and that is drilled into our<br> minds so eventually one starts taking the blame for every<br> wrong doing that happens in ones life.<br>
