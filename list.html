            I remember going to open markets are being grabbed when I was 18. I remember getting upset and speaking up only to be told that I will make the situation worse. So basically if you defend yourself or speak up against someone they can do something worse to you so women stay quiet.<br>

            Having to be covered head to toe for safety reasons and can’t go out alone, internalized misogyny in the culture - mothers have learned it and raise their kids in the same way. Not given the same opportunities as other males in the house.

        <div class="listText">Lack of safe public transport
            Lack of harrassment reporting systems

        <div class="listText">Verbal abuse, discrimination, bias
        </div>

        <div class="listText">There is this template of a "good Pakistani girl" or a "good desi girl" that a lot of women are expected to follow and it includes having your family be your first priority and your own ambitions and desires be the last. The strange thing is that even if you aren't doing anything "bad" you can still not be considered a good pakistani girl. For instance if a girl expressed that she wants to live in a completely different place from her family and a lot of people would question her almost as if its wrong. For a lot of Pakistani people they have this set way of how you should live your life and any deviations from that are seen as a form of rebellion. Often women are seen as children that need to be guided in terms of what they can and can't do with their lives but also to act like an adult by being a wife in training. This dichotomy is troubling because it's basically saying you have the responsibility to act like a grow woman but you are expected to be obedient like a child who doesn't know any better.
            I have friends who have tried to have conversations with their parents about what they are thinking and its been ineffective because people are simply not willing to listen to Pakistani women on how she wants to live her life. Especially an unmarried Pakistani woman because in many older people's eyes they dont have any merit to have a voice or make their own decisions.
        </div>

        <div class="listText">Coming from the USA and visiting Pakistan, I would experience mainly odd stares and women commenting on my body openly.

        </div>

        <div class="listText">Yes, Every time there was a chance for men to portray their true selves. Countless times, during interviews, shopping, working etc

        </div>

        <div class="listText">Unfortunately I have experienced all three: Bias, Abuse and Harassment. From being stared down with disgusting, frustrated eyes, no matter how covered you are, to being touched inappropriately if you walked down a crowded street or even when you went to your tailor for a fitting had become part of the norm. As a women you are always told to cover up, look down, stay quiet and stay alert, creating a fear within you as you grew up to expect the rule and will of men to run wild. I observed how women always ran amuck making sure their men were served and comfortable. You knew without even being told that men had the upper hand. Being raised in a household where my dad wanted me to have a voice as a woman, the contrast was very stark when I stepped outside my house. Even though I was given a very good education, I sensed a bias when compared to my brother as it was imperative for him to get the best as he was expected to run a household and be in charge, while I was expected to get educated, marry well and have kids. While my brother was sent abroad to study, I had to choose something within a driving distance so that I can be dropped and picked up. Why? Because what would my uncles think? What would the society think?

        </div>
        <div class="listText">Though I am working but still I dont have the independence that is required for a person to freely move. I have to ask for permission for mostly everything and cant do things on my own. People take advantage of my simplicity at workplace as I can not say no to work and for that matter I am overloaded with work or given a task which I am not suppose to do but I still do it. Forced to believe that a woman is always wrong may that be driving a car on the road or looking after your kids or even cooking in your own kitchen...a man can never be wrong and that is drilled into our minds so eventually one starts taking the blame for every wrong doing that happens in ones life.

        <div class="listText">There have been many but I’ll mention a few. I was out having dinner with family this one time there was a group of grown men sitting at the table in front of us, I caught two of them looking at me but I ignored and kept talking to my sister, few minutes later my mum tells me to go outside and she’s really pissed, I look back at those guys and I see their phone pointed towards me, clearly they were taking a picture or video of me. Oh and I was wearing an abaya jbtw.
            Another time I went on a drive with my sisters, they were sitting in the back talking and our driver was in the passenger's seat (me and my sisters aren’t allowed to drive without him fsr) anyway I notice him looking at my legs but I ignore it obviously but then he grabs my hand and just keeps his hand rested on top of mine for a few seconds and then he slides his hand off. I don’t know if this counts as any form of harassment but it made me really uncomfortable and angry. I froze and I didn’t know what to do or say. I stopped going on drives after that because he’s the only person I could drive with and I didn’t know how to tell my dad because I was afraid he’d tell me it wasn’t a big deal or if he’d get mad at me instead

        <div class="listText">I haven’t personally faced bias, but I have faced the general constraints that women have to face in our society e.g safety concerns, not going out as much.

            It starts from men continuously undermining my ability to drive or park my car to following me on their bikes. I have lost count of the number of times I've been forced to take different and longer routes to my house.
