Unfortunately I have experienced all three: Bias, Abuse and Harassment.<br> From being stared down with disgusting, frustrated eyes, no matter <br>how covered you are, to being touched inappropriately if you walked<br> down a crowded street or even when you went to your tailor for a fitting<br> had become part of the norm. As a women you are always told to<br> cover up, look down, stay quiet and stay alert, creating a fear within <br>you as you grew up to expect the rule and will of men to run wild.<br> I observed how women always ran amuck making sure their men <br>were served and comfortable. You knew without even being told that <br>men had the upper hand. Being raised in a household where my dad<br> wanted me to have a voice as a woman, the contrast was very stark when<br> I stepped outside my house. Even though I was given a very good education,<br> I sensed a bias when compared to my brother as it was imperative for <br>him to get the best as he was expected to run a household and be in charge, <br>while I was expected to get educated, marry well and have kids.<br> While my brother was sent abroad to study, I had to choose something <br>within a driving distance so that I can be dropped and picked up.<br> Why? Because what would my uncles think? What would <br>the society think?
