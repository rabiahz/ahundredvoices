    <div class="babText"> Thereâ€™s so much a Pakistani woman puts at stake when she chooses to simply<br> speak up. However, without realizing, she gives  so many more women the <br> courage to talk and an environment where they can be vulnerable yet feel safe.<br>  This website provides those women a forum that brings them together to <br> share their stories that are otherwise unheard of and an insight on what it<br> is like being a woman in Pakistan. You can also be a part of this website by<br> submitting a survey anonymously and share your own story. <br>Please know you are not alone in this fight.
