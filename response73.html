So many of men from my extended family don't want<br> to see me work and earning. And used to question<br> my mother for that. "Why is she earning; are you using<br> her money in your expenses?" They even tried to stop <br> my education but my mom was a great support.<br> Even shamed my father saying "Beti k pese khata hai"<br> My father is a retired officer. He worked throughout<br> his life just for us.
