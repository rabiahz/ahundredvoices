        There is this template of a "good Pakistani girl" or a "good desi girl" that a<br> lot of women are expected to follow and it includes having your family <br>be your first priority and your own ambitions and desires be the last.<br> The strange thing is that even if you aren't doing anything "bad" you can <br>still not be considered a good Pakistani girl. For instance if a girl<br> expressed that she wants to live in a completely different place from<br> her family and a lot of people would question her almost as if its wrong.<br> For a lot of pakistani people they have this set way of how you should<br> live your life and any deviations from that are seen as a form of rebellion.<br> Often women are seen as children that need to be guided in terms of <br>what they can and can't do with their lives but also to act like an adult <br>by being a wife in training. This dichotomy is troubling because it's<br> basically saying you have the responsibility to act like a grow woman but<br> you are expected to be obedient like a child who doesn't know any better.<br>
        I have friends who have tried to have conversations with their parents <br>about what they are thinking and its been ineffective because people are <br>simply not willing to listen to Pakistani women on how she wants to live <br>her life. Especially an unmarried Pakistani woman becausein many older people's<br> eyes they dont have any merit to have a voice or make their own decisions.
