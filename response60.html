     There have been many but I’ll mention a few. I was out having<br> dinner with family this one time there was a group of grown men <br>sitting at the table in front of us, I caught two of them looking at<br> me but I ignored and kept talking to my sister, few minutes later<br> my mum tells me to go outside and she’s really pissed, I look back at<br> those guys and I see their phone pointed towards me, clearly they <br>were taking a picture or video of me. Oh and I was wearing an abaya<br> jbtw.
            Another time I went on a drive with my sisters, they were <br>sitting in the back talking and our driver was in the passenger's seat <br>(me and my sisters aren’t allowed to drive without him fsr) anyway <br>I notice him looking at my legs but I ignore it obviously but then <br>he grabs my hand and just keeps his hand rested on top of mine for a <br>few seconds and then he slides his hand off. I don’t know if this counts<br> as any form of harassment but it made me really uncomfortable and<br> angry. I froze and I didn’t know what to do or say. I stopped going<br> on drives after that because he’s the only person I could drive with <br>and I didn’t know how to tell my dad because I was afraid he’d tell me<br> it wasn’t a big deal or if he’d get mad at me instead
